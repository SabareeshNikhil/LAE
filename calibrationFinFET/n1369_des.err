A larger fraction than 1/100 of the propagated particles crossed the border of the Monte Carlo window at a non-contact locations.
This may be indicative of bad placement of the Monte Carlo window: current evaluation by particle counting ("-useTestFunction") requires current carrying contacts to be included in the Monte Carlo window.
If you don't want the Monte Carlo window to extend all the way to the contacts, please specify "useTestFunction" in the MonteCarlo section to disable particle counting.

Note:
As a safe-guard against incorrect autodetection of the Monte Caro carrier type it is suggested to add "particleType=electrons|holes" to the MonteCarlo section of the command file when extending the Monte Carlo window !
